#Collaboration with universities in the DRC
Repository to collect and share information regarding open sources of information related to power supply and emerging technologies. A focus will be on developing courses and extracurricular activities at universities giving students practical skills that they can apply in real life. This includes mechanical knowledge on how to fix Diesel generators as the cost of replacement is high, as well as how to manufacture low cost hydropower. 

The general idea is to equip students with technical know-how as well as business skills so that they can create their own businesses and jobs.

##Current Challenges, Background (WIP)
* bad to no infrastructure (regarding roads, power supply, etc.)
* most electricity is generated by local Diesel generators, that break often and are expensive both to run and replace - hence, they only run for a handful of hours a day
* feature phones and smartphones are ubiquitous
* mobile internet is affordable:
  * 80 MB bundles that expire in 12 hours cost US$2
  * 50 GB bundles that expire in 1 month cost US$100
  * 1 GB night-tariff (1am through 7am) US$1
